## Data Disclaimer ##

This dataset is not intended for any use other than running unit tests against
the software in the repositories listed above. Data contained in this repository
should not be expected to reflect, for example, real-world radio propagation links.
In some instances, intentionally invalid data are provided to ensure that errors
are properly handled in the software under test.

## Dataset Versioning ##

The versioning of this dataset is tracked with a single-digit version number
in the format `v1`. This version number indicates the software versions for which
this test dataset is valid. For example, `v1` of this repository contains the dataset
used to test `v1.x` of the base C++ library and `v1.x.y` of the .NET, MATLAB®, and Python®
wrappers.

## Dataset Contents ##

Each CSV file in this repository contains a set of inputs and outputs used to test
the operation of one of the functions provided by the software under test.
The header row of each file indicates the name of each data column, and each subsequent row
represents a single test case.

- `HeightGainTerminalCorrectionModelTestData.csv` contains sets of inputs and outputs used
  to test the operation of the `HeightGainTerminalCorrectionModel` function.
- `TerrestrialStatisticalModelTestData.csv` contains sets of inputs and outputs used
  to test the operation of the `TerrestrialStatisticalModel` function.
- `AeronauticalStatisticalModelTestData.csv` contains sets of inputs and outputs used
  to test the operation of the `AeronauticalStatisticalModel` function.
